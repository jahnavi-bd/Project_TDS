# Project using Tools in Data Science - 1 

* Data Scraping Explanation - Using GitHub API token, I fetched user details and their public repositories of Melbourne users with 100+ followers, storing the results in CSV files for easy analysis.


* Interesting Fact -Three fascinating obsesrvations:
  * Firstly, Javascript was the most popular at the earliest and latest times.
  * Secondly, "Developers write long bios" have a BIG impact on followers.
  * Thirdly, "Number of followers" and the "Number of public repositories" doesn't affect one another if any one of those changes,i.e.they are independent.


* Recommendation for Developers - Developers should actively engage with others in their region as collaboration can lead to innovative projects and solutions, Ex: Engage with popular languages Python to attract more followers, Tasks provoking developers could help them and public be in two-way communication.
